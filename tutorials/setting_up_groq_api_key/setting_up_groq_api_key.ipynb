        "3. Next a pop-up will show up for you to add your unique API key name:\n",
        "![API Name](groq2.PNG)\n",
        "4. Once you click **Submit** a new pop-up will show up, but this time with the actual API key, and make sure to copy it because that will be the only time it is available to see.\n",
        "5. That is all! You should have your GROQ API key already active and ready to use. You can check the demo below for a quick-start on how to use your API key with Python. I reccomend also checking Groq's documentation to explore all the possibilities available [here](https://console.groq.com/docs/overview)."
